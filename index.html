        The World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly known as the Web, is an information system where 
        documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators 
        (URLs, such as <a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com/</a>), which may be 
        interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] <br>The resources of 
        the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by 
        users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software 
        application called a web server. <br>The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, 
        which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon the technologies of which 
        the Web is built.

        English scientist Tim Berners-Lee co-invented the World Wide Web in 1989 along with 
        Robert Cailliau. <br>He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, 
        Switzerland.[3][4] <br>The browser was released outside CERN to other research institutions 
        starting in January 1991, and then to the general public in August 1991. <br>The Web began to 
        enter everyday use in 1993â€“1994, when websites for general use started to become available.
        [5] <br>The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is 
        the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.
