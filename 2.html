    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a>
    is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in 
    a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, 
    <u>alongside HTML and JavaScript.</u>[2]
    </p>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, 
        colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide 
        more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;<br> 
        enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate 
        .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable 
        the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share 
        the file and its formatting.
    </p>
    <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page 
        in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, 
        by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. 
        CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
